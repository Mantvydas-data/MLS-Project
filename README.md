<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This repository contains assessment for Machine Learning and Statistics 2022 module. Files include: requirements, gitignore, readme file, SVG graph, Jupyter notebooks:Timeseries Anomaly Detection using Keras and module exercises. <br>
Assessment instructions can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/2223-S1-machine-learn-stats/blob/main/assessment/2223-machine-learning-stats-assessment.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Problem statement</h3>

<p>Regular tasks (40%):</p>
<p>The lecture notes suggest concepts you should explore.</p>
<p>You should complete these in notebooks each week.</p>
<p>Plots explaining main concepts.</p>
<p>Code demonstrating key algorithms.</p>
<p>Well-written explanations.</p>
<p>Machine Learning Project Notebook (40%):</p>
<p>On the Keras website, there is an example of time-series anomaly detection. Re-create this example in a notebook of your own, explaining the concepts</p>
<p>Clearly explain each Keras function used, referring to the documentation.</p>
<p>Include an introduction to your notebook, setting the context and describing what the reader can expect as they read down through the notebook.</p>
<p>Include a conclusion section where you suggest improvements you could make to the analysis in the notebook.</p>
<br>

<h3>Running the code</h3>

<p>Assignment has been completed using Python version 3.9.15 that can be downloaded <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a> with Anaconda version 22.11.1 that can be downloaded <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">here</a>. While Python and related libraries-packages can be installed separately it is encouraged to use latest Anaconda distribution that provides a wide variety of data science related tools.</p>

    
<p>To run the code <a href="https://github.com/Mantvydas-data/MLS-Project.git">repository</a> is to be cloned or files to be downloaded manually as Zip file by following <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo">Github guide</a>. Commander of choice can be used, that will require navigation to repository download location, launching of <a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/starting.html">Jupyter</a> environment in home directory of the project files saved.</p>
